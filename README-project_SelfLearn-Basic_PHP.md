# Project Title : selfLearn_PHP-Basic

As the title project, this project is a basic project system developmeny to the beginner PHP out there
regarding the back-end using PHP (hence, thats why there are no design so that you can focus on the logic)

## Getting Started

You need to download the repo so that you will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Editor : Notepad++, Visual Basic Code etc
Server : APACHE, Tomcat Server server etc
Language : PHP. For the design later, when you already understood the basic here, you can use to combine with HTML & JS
Database : MySQL or phpAdmin Database etc

However to make it easy for you, its better to just used notepad++ as and editor and XAMPP since XAMPP contain all that you need.
(in Xampp installation, choose to download APACHE server, php language & phpadmin database)

or you can download xampp(download apache server & php language in the xampp controller), notepad++ & mysql database.

### Import Database Data into MySQL / phpAdmin database (either way)
1. MySQL Database
	- if u choose to install mysql just simply open the automatic connection that already been create when you install mysql
	- once u are in, click on File > Open Sql Script > Look up for file entitled database.sql > click icon run to execute
	- the database would automatically create for u
	- database name should be : 
	
2. phpAdmin database 
	- Once install, run MySQL.
	- At the XAMPP Control Panel click 'ADMIN' button (it would redirect you to phpMyAdmin, which is your database)
	- Click on the import and find the file name 'database.sql'
	- The database data and table would automatically create for you.
	- link for your database: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php 

## Running the file/development test

1. At the XAMPP Control Panel click the 'EXPLORER' file icon.
2. Paste all the file code that you got from me & put it under the file 'htdocs'
    To make it easy, just simply copy the folder selfLearn_PHP-Basic
     So your project location would be at C:\xampp\htdocs\selfLearn_PHP-Basic
      Make sure if you intend to add new file under this project to update the system functionality,
       Dont forget to put the extension .php in your file name
3. Open your browser and open the address of the file that you want to access or your index file (incase you do the development system) 
	For example in devemploment system, you have the login.php as the index file.
	As for this development project to access http://localhost/selfLearn_PHP-Basic/login.php
4. If not working, just simple type in localhost at your browser. You shud see XAMPP Dashboard. 
	If you didnt see it, you need to check the Port availability either it was used by the other server like IIS, Tomcat & etc
	 link to see if your server is up http://localhost/dashboard/ 
5. if you want to check the data, then you need to open the database that you intall.
